# Thesis Project â€“ Fokus (working title)

I'm building a planning tool (a combined calendar and to-do list, with a possiblity of tracking and discovering the users habits, both good and bad) designed to help people, especially those with ADD symptoms, manage everyday tasks, habits, and stress.

The project is part of my UX/UI design education and will demonstrate both technical skills and UX thinking. The goal is to create a responsive and accessible web application that complies with WCAG 2.1 (Level A & AA).

I need help with:

- Structuring the codebase (frontend, potentially backend as well)
- Setting up components
- Designing with accessibility and responsiveness in mind
- Iterating on ideas, flows, and copywriting
